## Automated testing

As most people in the software industry know, there are distinct differences between manual testing and automated testing. Manual testing requires physical time and effort to ensure the software code does everything it’s supposed to do. In addition, manual testers have to make a record of their findings. This involves checking log files, external services and the database for errors. If you’re familiar with manual testing, you know this process can be extremely time-consuming and repetitive.

### What is Automated Testing?

Automated testing is, well, automated. This differs from manual testing where a human being is responsible for single-handedly testing the functionality of the software in the way a user would. Because automated testing is done through an automation tool, less time is needed in exploratory tests and more time is needed in maintaining test scripts while increasing overall test coverage.

The benefit of manual testing is that it allows a human mind to draw insights from a test that might otherwise be missed by an automated testing program. Automated testing is well-suited for large projects; projects that require testing the same areas over and over; and projects that have already been through an initial manual testing process.

### Implementing a Test Automation Strategy

The move to agile has led many teams to adopt a pyramid testing strategy. The test automation pyramid strategy calls for automating tests at three different levels. Unit testing represents the base and biggest percentage of this test automation pyramid. Next comes, service layer, or API testing. And finally, [GUI tests](https://smartbear.com/learn/automated-testing/why-gui-testing/) sit at the top. The pyramid looks something like this:

An integrated GUI and API testing solution such as TestComplete can make the process of implementing a test automation pyramid easier as it ensures changes made to the API test cases are automatically reflected at the GUI level as well.

### Who should be involved with test automation?

Testing in these short Agile iterations often necessitates a “[shift left](https://smartbear.com/learn/automated-testing/shifting-left-in-testing)” approach. This shift left in agile development process means testing starts much earlier in the application lifecycle. As a result, in such an approach, developers with strong technical expertise are increasingly being held accountable for testing, and thus, they often work alongside testers to create [test automation frameworks](https://smartbear.com/learn/automated-testing/test-automation-frameworks/).

When evaluating a testing solution, it’s important to have a tool that fits the needs of all of the different team members who will be involved in the testing process. These include:

- **Manual testers**: Record and replay is crucial for manual testers, especially those who are new to automation. Being able to use the same recorded script with variety of input data can come in handy while identifying and fixing problems across multiple environments.
- **Automation engineers**: For automation engineers, robust support for scripting languages, integrations with CI systems, and the ability to scale tests easily could be important.
- **Developers**: Implement testing into the development process requires the ability to conduct tests within IDEs such as Eclipse and Visual Studio.
