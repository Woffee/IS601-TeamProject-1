## Describing how to clone in Github

While working with a repository on GitHub, one might want to have it on his local machine to make it easier to work with. For example, to allow him to use the desired text editor, to add and remove files, or to fix conflicts. The process of copying the repository from GitHub to your local machine is called as cloning.

Cloning a repository pulls down a full copy of all the repository data that GitHub has at that point in time, including all versions of every file and folder for the project. At any point, one can push his changes to the remote repository on GitHub, or pull other people's changes from GitHub.

One can either clone his existing repository or, to contribute to a project, clone another person's existing repository.
